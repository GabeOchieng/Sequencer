    "# Exampes with natural images\n",
    "In this notebook I show several examples with natural images. The rows (and columns) in a natural image form a clear one-dimensional sequence. Therefore, we can shuffle the rows by changing their relative order. Considering each row as a separate 1D object, we can define the shuffled image as the input dataset and apply the Sequencer to it. We can then reorder the rows according to the detected sequence, and to check whether the Sequencer was able to recover the original image. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The images I use in this notebook are taken from the COCO dataset (link: XXX). In particular, I used images from the 2017 validation set. <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook consists of the following parts: <br>\n",
    "1. **Loading and shuffling a natural image:** this part of the notebook will contain functions that I need to load and shuffle images. <br>\n",
    "2. **Applying the Sequencer to a set of shuffled images:** in this part of the notebook we will apply the Sequencer to a set of shuffled images, and will check whether the Sequencer is able to recover the original images. <br>\n",
    "3. **Application of tSNE and UMAP to a shuffled image:** in this part of the notebook I will try to reorder the shuffled images using tSNE and UMAP. I will apply tSNE and UMAP to the shuffled image, and using their one-dimensional embedding, I will reorder the rows to obtain a reconstructed image. Both tSNE and UMAP depend on several hyper-parameters. In the Jupyter notebook `comparison_with_tsne_and_umap.ipynb` in the examples directory, I showed that one can define an axis ratio of the resulting embedding by tSNE and UMAP, and use it as a figure of merit to optimize the hyper parameters of various dimensionality reduction algorithms. In this part of the notebook I will demonstrate this by examining tSNE/UMAP hyper-parameters, and comparing the axis ratios of the resulting embeddings."
